### Task 1-Iris Flowers Classification ML Project     


   - This particular ML project is usually referred to as the “Hello World” of Machine Learning. 

   - The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.
